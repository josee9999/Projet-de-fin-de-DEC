# RMT Example

This example shows the use of the `espp::Rmt` and `espp::RmtEncoder` classes of
the `rmt` component for driving an LED.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

This example is designed to be run on a
[TinyS3](https://esp32s3.com/tinys3.html) to control its WS2812 LED using the
ESP RMT peripheral.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
